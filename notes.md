## Notes
### Today's goals 03/02/2025 

1. Lexer
- Lexer shouldn't only separate by ' ' but for *TypeChecking*
    - Make type structure with int, str, etc...
2. Simple AST
- Try getting tokens inside of the AST

### TODOs
- Why use pragma?

### WHART?
When reading a file, the EOF shows up as 10;0;0
``` 
ASCII |   10    ;  0  ;  0
HUMAN |LINE FEED, NULL, NULL
```
